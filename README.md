# Simple Linear Regression

This repository contains an implementation of **Simple Linear Regression**, a basic machine learning technique used to model the relationship between two variables.

## 📂 Project Files
- `simple_linear_reg.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis for the Simple Linear Regression model.

## 🔍 Overview
Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method for summarizing and studying relationships between two continuous (quantitative) variables:
- **Dependent Variable (Y):** The outcome we're trying to predict.
- **Independent Variable (X):** The predictor variable used to explain variations in the dependent variable.

This project demonstrates:
1. Data preprocessing.
2. Fitting a Simple Linear Regression model.
3. Evaluating model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.
4. Visualizing the regression line and data points.

## 📊 Libraries Used
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vinod1543/Simple_linear_regression.git
2.Open the Jupyter Notebook file (simple_linear_reg.ipynb) in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, VS Code).

3.Run the notebook cells step-by-step to:
  .   Load and preprocess the dataset.
  .   Train the Simple Linear Regression model.
  .   Evaluate and visualize the results.


📈 Results
The regression model predicts the dependent variable based on the independent variable with visualizations like:

 . Scatter plots with the regression line.
 . Residual analysis.
